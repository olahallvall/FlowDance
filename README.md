# FlowDance
FlowDance goals is to support the following scenario:
- Interservice communication between microservices (Database-per-Service Pattern).
- Replace distributed transactions calls driven by MSDTC with common synchronous RPC-calls sharing a Correlation ID.
- Moving away from strong consistency to eventual consistency using the Compensating Transaction pattern.
- Reducing long-running locks in the database due to distributed transactions supporting ACID.      

## Breaking up the distributed monolith
![Distributed monolith](Docs/distributed-monolith.png)
When moving away from an monolith to an microservices solution it's easy to ends up with something like picture below. Synchronous choreography-based call chains thatÂ´s cuts through the entire solution.  
The solution upholds strong consistency by using distributed transaction based on MSDTC throughout the complete solution.
FlowDance takes a aim at reducing or eliminate the need of distributed transaction between microservices based on MSDTC.



By extracting data from synchronous choreography based call chains into a Saga, FlowDance can support Compensating Transaction pattern.
      

FlowDance consist of a Client library and back-end service based on RabbitMQ and Microsoft Azure Durable Functions.
